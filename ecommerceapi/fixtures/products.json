            "description": "Built around an early-2000s Designer Series Stratocaster, Tom’s “Soul Power” Strat was the primary guitar he used onstage and in the studio while playing with supergroup Audioslave. The foundation of the “Soul Power” Strat is a resonant and rich-sounding alder slab body balanced by a snappy combination of a maple neck and a rosewood fretboard. The electronics are modified to fit Tom’s specs with Vintage Noiseless pickups in the neck and middle positions and a Seymour Duncan Hot Rail in the bridge position. Tom’s “Soul Power” also comes with a distinctive hardware package, which includes an authentic Floyd Rose tremolo and a kill-switch toggle. Tom Morello has inspired generations of guitarists — counting many of us at Sweetwater — and the “Soul Power” Strat is a stellar tribute to his distinctive style that is certain to inspire your playing.",
